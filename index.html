		<h3>Blake Kelley</h3>
		<p><em>About Me</em></p>
		<p>
			Normally described as a conundrum, you won't find your average tech nerd here. Although I specialize in building web applications (among other things), 
			I am often spending my time spraying dirt on my motorcycles, shredding on a jet ski, or peddling through terrain on a bike. I have always been invested in the moto way of life. 
			I am organized, detailed, and invested in whatever I am working on. I also spend a lot of my time further developing my skillsets in all aspects. 
			I enjoy stimulating my cognitive side and exploring new situations. Difficult tasks do not deter me and only further my need to solve them. 
			I am not afraid to look to other resources around me when necessary. Please take a moment to see where I've been and what I have accomplished.

				In May of 2017 WhiteCloud Analytics was acquired by <a href="https://www.relias.com/">Relias</a> (formerly Relias Learning). With this change came new opportunity to move around in the company. I moved to a team that was responsible for creating a Common Data Platform which would be the central hub for loading, housing, maintaining, and reporting for all analytics applications. On the team I worked on creating a web application that would allow for other developers to create metrics in a fraction of the time. I also helped create and maintain the automated build and deploy using Bamboo and Octopus. Created automated scripts for quickly setting up or restoring to a fresh state on the servers as well as local development machines. Used Biml and BimlScript to convert the existing load packages into dynamic and modular script files. This allowed existing packages and any new packages to be created using a simple configuration file.

			<em>2014 - 2017</em>
			<p class="job-description">
				Following a year and a half intership with WhiteCloud, I was offered a full time position on the Research team. My team works directly with St Luke's Health System, 
				taking feedback on what type of problems they are trying to solve and quickly creating applications focused around achieving outcomes. I worked directly on an application focused
				around improving the quality of care provided to patients. I started taking over this application as an intern and fully lead by the time I was hired full time. From there I focused
				much of my time automating the data load, cleaning up the database, and rewriting application code for reusability so that I could focus on other endeavors. The question of Single Sign On
				was brought up in an effort to reduce the user support by members of our team. In order for this to be possible, I needed to move our applications to a framework that could support SSO. 
				I took the lead on recreating our front end application with ASP.NET MVC, having no knowledge of the MVC framework or SSO, I took the initiative to learn what I needed to accomplish this task.
				Most recently I joined a team focused on creating a platform for loading, processing, and maintaining the various healthcare oragnizations data.

				<li>Lead developer responsible for the introduction and implementation of ASP.NET MVC web applications for internal use as well as client interaction</li>

				After a couple years of school I started looking around for an internship at a tech company and came across WhiteCloud, a small startup in downtown Boise.
				Upon applying I was able to secure a position where began taking on simple tasks of fixing bugs, adding minor updates, and taking over data loads.
				When the need for a front end ASP.NET VB application to be taking over, updated, and maintained I eagerly stepped up to task.
				This was my first non-CMS website and I was able to take it from a basic web page that displayed the current users list of application and expand it to add administrative functionality.
				With that the application allowed the creation of users which would create the user in the Active Directory and add them to the list of groups while also updating the information in the database.
